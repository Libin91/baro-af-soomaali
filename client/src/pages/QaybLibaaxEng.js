            <h1>The Share of the Lion</h1>
            <p>Once upon a time, the animals of the savannah hunted and killed a prey. They decided to come together to decide how to share the food. The Lion, who was the king of the animals, said:</p>
            <p>“Oh Hyena, divide it up for us!”</p>
            <p>The Hyena divided the meat into two.</p>
            <p>“Take this half” said the Hyena, “o Lion, and leave the other half to the rest of the animals.”</p>
            <p>The Lion was not happy with it, so it slapped the Hyena very hard. The Hyena, in pain, went away.</p>
            <p>The Lion then charged the Jackal with dividing up the meat. The Jackal gave all of the meat to the Lion. The Lion laughed and said:</p>
            <p>“O Jackal, who taught you to divide things in such a fair way?”</p>
            <p>The Jackal said:</p>
            <p>“The hard slap that was given to the Hyena taught me!”</p>
