            <h1>The Shell of the Tortoise</h1>
            <p>It is said that in the ancient times the tortoise didn’t have the hard shell that now protects its body. Its body was made of fat with no lean muscles.</p>
            <p>One night, all the animals had a meeting. They decided that the first one among them that reached the tortoise in the morning could eat it. That same night, the Jackal went to see the Tortoise.</p>
            <p>“O Tortoise, we decided that the first one of us that gets you in the morning will eat you. So, what are you going to do?”</p>
            <p>The Tortoise said:</p>
            <p>“Was God there with you at the meeting?”</p>
            <p>“No” replied the Jackal.</p>
            <p>“Then your plan is not going to work!” said the Tortoise.</p>
            <p>The Jackal left. It hid in a place  near the Tortoise, so it could be the first one to catch the Tortoise before any of the other animals. Early in the morning, the Jackal went to catch the Tortoise. However the Jackal soon discovered that the Tortoise now had a hard shell covering its body, which made it impossible for any of the animals to bite it.</p>
            <p>This shows us that no one’s plan can be successful unless God allows it. </p>
