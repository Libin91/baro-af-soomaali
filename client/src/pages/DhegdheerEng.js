            <h1>The Death of Dheghdheer</h1>
            <p>Dhegdheer lived in a place called Boholaha Xergagan.</p>
            <p>She lived with her only daughter. Her daughter, unlike her mother, was not a cannibal, and she didn’t like her mother at all.</p>
            <p>One day, two lost children came to her house. The daughter decided to hide the children from her mother.</p> 
            <p>At night, when it was time to go to bed, Dhegdheer smelled blood and told her daughter that she could smell human beings nearby.</p>
            <p>Her daughter replied: “Impossible!”.</p>
            <p>Dhegdheer’s daughter could not tolerate her mother and her actions anymore, and she hoped, one day, to stop her, and get rid of her for good.</p>
            <p>When Dhegdheer sleeps, her long ear relaxed and folded on itself, when she was awake, her long ear would stand up.</p>
            <p>That same night, after Dhegdheer had gone to bed, her daughter and the two children decided it was time to eliminate her. After checking that her ear was relaxed, and she was indeed sleeping, they took a hot metal rod and inserted it in her ear. This was the demise of Dhegdheer.</p>
            <p>When the news of her spread to the village near Boholaha Xergagan, the girl sang: “Dhegdheer is dead, the world is in peace!”</p>
